# MockBotSquarePants
A bot that lets you say exactly what that idiot just said but in a mocking tone of text.

# Where to get
You can invite the bot into your home here: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=686696556610715694&permissions=2048&scope=bot
The bot is now hosted for free (and hopefully forever) via Heroku! So all you should have to do is accept the bot invitation and you're ready to start mocking!

# Description
Too often I find myself wanting to mock someone for something they just said. It's during these times that out-right making fun of them just doesn't do the trick. It was then that I learned about this meme. Essentially, the internet trolls have attached a sarcastic and mocking tone to alternating capitalization in a string of text. Just take a quick second to type in "spongebob mocking meme" and you will be met with plenty of golden examples for every scenario.

<br>
All that being said, I needed a way to mock my friends in the platform we use the most: Discord. Thankfully, the wonderful people at Discord love nerds, and allow us to make cool bots to do (basically) anything we want. So what did I use it for? Stupid things, like always.

# How it works
Simply copy the text of your victim, prepend it with `~mock ` and you're done! MockBotSquarePants will swoop in to mock them!
