# MockBotSquarePants
A bot that lets you say exactly what that idiot just said but in a mocking tone of text.


# Description
Too often I find myself wanting to mock someone for something they just said. It's during these times that out-right making fun of them just doesn't do the trick. It was then that I learned about this meme. Essentially, the internet trolls have attached a sarcastic and mocking tone to alternating capitalization in a string of text. Just take a quick second to type in "spongebob mocking meme" and you will be met with plenty of golden examples for every scenario.

All that being said, I needed a way to mock my friends in the platform we use the most: Discord. Thankfully, the wonderful people at Discord love nerds, and allow us to make cool bots to do (basically) anything we want. So what did I use it for? Stupid things, like always.

# How it works
Simply copy the text of your victim, prepend it with `~mock ` and you're done! MockBotSquarePants will swoop in to mock them!

# Setup
Looking for the easiest solution possible. If you want to do it *right now*, check out these documents. But I'll update this once I have some easier solution (if it exists).
